The scripts have been used to create the queries but don't always produce the exact result of the txt files. 

The code needs to be revised, in particular the usage of the indexes of the extract function to make it more
re-usable. In this way the different .py files could be gropued in only one (like in "4-multiple.py").

As said above other things are missing, for example some of the "on conflcit do nothing".
So read the script only to have an idea of how the data have been converted into a query.
